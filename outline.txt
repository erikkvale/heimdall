Problem Overview
----------------

The customer runs a website and periodically is attacked by a botnet in a Distributed Denial of
Service (DDOS) attack. Youâ€™ll be given a log file in Apache log format from a given attack. Use
this log to build a simple real-time detector of DDOS attacks.

Requirements
------------

1) Ingest
- Read a file from local disk and write to a message system such as Kafka.

2) Detection
- Write an application which reads messages from the message system and
detects whether the attacker is part of the DDOS attack
- Once an attacker is found, the ip-address should be written to a results directory
which could be used for further processing
- An attack should be detected one to two minutes after starting

First (well second ^) steps:
- Explore tech recommendations: Kafka, Spark, Cloudera VM/Docker
- Which best fits the problem of creating a real time DDOS detector? Is it simple to
setup and deploy? How would it scale? How do I test the functionality of the selected
technology for accuracy? Is this an internal tool? 

Language choices: Scala, Java, Python, Shell, C
